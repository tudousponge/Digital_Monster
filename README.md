### 是什么引发了流言/假新闻的进一步传播？

	1.The increasing penetration of the internet provides a fertile ground for the spread of misinformation: “False information has always existed and fake news has been a part of online news since it began” (Brennan, 2017, p. 179).
         From <https://journals-sagepub-com.lib-ezproxy.hkbu.edu.hk/doi/full/10.1177/0002764219869402>             
	2. False news spreads deeper and faster than authentic news due to humans rather than robots. 
	(The spread of true and false news online From <https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146> )
	3. People are excited by the novelty in false news and are more likely to spread it than robots
	(The spread of true and false news online From <https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146> )
	4. Social bots play a key role in the spread of fake news.
     (The spread of fake news by social bots  https://www.andyblackassociates.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fakenewsbots.pdf)
	5. 媒介的引导作用。《后真相时代》：報紙常採用掩飾部分真相的新聞標題，藉以吸引讀者好奇的眼光，然後在較少人閱讀的正文內容，才還原完整真相；政治人物會使用化妝修飾的真相（spin truth），社運人士（activist）會採用最有利的真相，儘管有時候，那些真相並不足以代表全部。
	本書作者麥當納將溝通者分為三類：
	（1）倡議者（advocate）：為了實現某個有益目標，選用矛盾真相來營造某種還算正確的現實印象；
	（2）誤傳者（misinformer）：出於無知，散佈矛盾真相，卻在無意間扭曲了現實；
	（3）誤導者（misleader）：故意利用矛盾真相，來製造某種自己明知不對的現實印象。

	6.Algorithmic curation and personalization systems place users in a filter bubble of content that decreases their likelihood of encountering ideologically cross-cutting news content.

### what is fake news?
	1. The former defines fake news either as “disinformation or falsehoods presented as real news” or “actual news that is claimed to be untrue,” while the latter defines it as “false, often sensational, information disseminated under the guise of news reporting.” 
	2. Misinformation became Dictionary.com’s Word of the Year in 2018, which is defined as “false information that is spread, regardless of whether there is intent to mislead”  (Sherman, E. (2018, November 26). 
    from (http://fortune.com/2018/11/26/misinformation-dictionary-com-word-year-misinformation-social-media-tech/)
	3. Examples of disinformation include deceptive political and commercial advertisements, government propaganda, forged documents, internet frauds, fake websites, and manipulated Wikipedia entries 
	(Fallis, D. (2015). What is disinformation? Library Trends, 63, 401-426. 
    From (https://journals-sagepub-com.lib-ezproxy.hkbu.edu.hk/doi/full/10.1177/0002764219869402)
	4. Since realism has been argued to be more persuasive when the information is intended to be used to guide someone’s action, “fake news” and misinformation can be a mix of real and fake information.
	（Andsager, J. L., Austin, E. W., Pinkleton, B. E. (2001). Questioning the value of realism: Young adults’ processing of messages in alcohol-related public service announcements and advertising. Journal of Communication, 51, 121-142.)
	5. Misinformation is not necessarily fake information. It is rather incomplete or inaccurate information, which could be valid and truthful. Nevertheless, scholars often interpret misinformation as misleading information, which is closer to the definition of fake news.
	（Karlova, N. A., Fisher, K. E. (2013). Plz RT: A social diffusion model of misinformation and disinformation for understanding human information behaviour. Information Research, 18(1), 1-17.)
	6. Fake news genre represents “programming where either the program’s central focus or a very specific and well-defined portion is devoted to political satire”
    From (https://journals-sagepub-com.lib-ezproxy.hkbu.edu.hk/doi/full/10.1177/0002764219869402)
	7. Rochlin (2017) argues that fake news in the posttruth era replace facts with emotions. 
    From (https://journals-sagepub-com.lib-ezproxy.hkbu.edu.hk/doi/full/10.1177/0002764219869402)
